  "about_title": "The GānCuju™️©️ Legend",
  "about_p1": "According to the GānCuju™️©️ legend, before Cuju, a simpler tool was used to play \"football\" in ancient China. GānCuju™️©️ was the game of common people, while imperial palaces had Cuju fields and vast walled secure areas.",
  "about_p2": "Ancient Chinese society was fundamentally rural. The vast majority of Chinese families lived in small farming villages, where children had to play within the village boundaries due to wild animals. Therefore, the following guidelines were essential in the design of the sports equipment:",
  "about_feature1": "takes up minimal space",
  "about_feature2": "easily portable",
  "about_feature3": "robust and durable",
  "about_p3": "Chinese bamboo provided the best solution for this. The flexibility and strength of bamboo perfectly symbolized the spirit of GānCuju™️©️: flexible yet resistant, just as players learned to adapt to different situations while maintaining their own strengths.",

  "features_title": "Why GānCuju™️©️?",
  "feature1_title": "Unbeatable in Play",
  "feature1_text": "GānCuju™️© is a high-intensity skill development game played in small areas. Every step on the field must be considered carefully, because with a wrong move, the opponent can easily exploit our mistake. Strategy and quick decision-making are the most important during the game. Only those who can immediately recognize and exploit the opponent's weaknesses can succeed.",
  "feature2_title": "A Game for Everyone",
  "feature2_text": "Due to its versatility, everyone can be successful in some version of GānCuju™️©. This gave incredible self-confidence that transferred to other areas of life. People who experienced the value of their own abilities in the game were able to handle personal conflicts more confidently and constructively.",
  "feature3_title": "Skin Perception Development",
  "feature3_text": "Through skin perception development, we can build reflexes that, unlike vision-based reactions, do not require the cerebral cortex in the stimulus process, making them much faster and more reliable. Various receptors are involved in touch-based reflexes, allowing us to determine the direction and speed of the incoming ball.",
  "feature4_title": "Daily Physical Activity",
  "feature4_text": "The game also served to educate children, as every parent is responsible for their child's upbringing, and neglecting this has a long-term negative impact on society. This ancient Chinese game developed hand and foot technique, strengthened self-confidence, playfully encouraged, and taught perseverance and self-control.",

  "science_tactile_desc": "Only 2 neural connections required",
  "science_advantage": "Competitive Advantage",
  "science_advantage_p1": "GānCuju™️©️ training develops the skin-based tactile reflexes that are approximately three times faster than visual reflexes. This is because tactile reflexes can bypass the cerebral cortex, creating a more direct pathway from stimulus to response.",
  "science_advantage_p2": "As players become more experienced, their reliance on visual processing decreases, and the tactile reflexes become more dominant, significantly reducing reaction times and improving performance.",
  "science_receptors": "Multiple Receptor Types",
  "science_receptors_p1": "The skin contains various receptors that detect touch, pressure, vibration, and tension. During GānCuju™️©️ training, these receptors become increasingly sensitive, allowing players to:",
  "science_receptors_li1": "Determine ball direction and speed through touch alone",
  "science_receptors_li2": "React to minimal contact instantly",
